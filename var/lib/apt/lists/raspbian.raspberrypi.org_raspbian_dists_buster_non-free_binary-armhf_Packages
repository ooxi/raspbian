Description: Sound files for the roguelike game angband
 Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived
 from the game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is
 often described as a "roguelike" game because the look and feel of
 the game is still quite similar to Rogue (though there are now graphical
 tiles available if you dislike ASCII gaming). Angband has been in more or
 less continuous development since the early 1990s.
 .
 Although angband is free, the sounds are under a non-commercial licence
 (Creative Commons BY-NC-SA) and are therefore considered non-free in Debian.
 Since the main game comes with no free sounds, install this package if you
 want sound.

Description: A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.9 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 did, so has been renamed so that the previous
 version can continue to be made available.

 The FASTA programs find regions of local or global similarity between
 Protein or DNA sequences, either by searching Protein or DNA databases,
 or by identifying local duplications within a sequence. Other
 programs provide information on the statistical significance of an
 alignment. Like BLAST, FASTA can be used to infer functional and
 evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify
 members of gene families.

Description: web service for transferring very large files
 F*EX (Frams's Fast File EXchange) is a service that can be used to allow
 users anywhere on the Internet to exchange very large files quickly and
 conveniently.
 .
 The sender uploads the file to the F*EX-server and the recipient
 automatically gets a notification e-mail with a download-URL.
 .
 Main features of F*EX:
 .
  * file transfer of virtually unlimited file size
  * sender and recipient only need an e-mail program and a web browser
    (of any kind; they do not have to install any software)
  * RESEND and REGET for resuming after link failures at last sent byte
  * auto-notification of recipient
  * auto-deletion after download
  * auto-deletion after expiration date (default: 5 days)
  * full-users can create one time upload URLs for foreign users
  * full-users can create sub-users, who can send only to this full-user
  * full-users can create groups, an analogy to mailing lists, but for files
  * admin can allow (internal or external) user self-registration
  * admin can allow upload to public recipients without authentication
  * admin can allow upload for LAN users without registration (anonymous upload)
  * maintenance-free: no administration necessary beyond creating new
    F*EX accounts
  * multiple recipients only require one stored copy
  * F*EX uses HTTP and needs no firewall tunnels
  * support for streams, too (SEX: Stream EXchange)
  * shell clients provided for commandline users: fexsend and fexget.

Description: Introduction to GCC by Brian J. Gough
 This manual provides a tutorial introduction to the GNU C and C++
 compilers, gcc and g++.
 .
 Many books teach the C and C++ languages, this book explains how to use
 the compiler itself. Based on years of observation of questions posted
 on mailing lists, it guides the reader straight to the important options
 of GCC!
 .
 Concisely written, with numerous easy-to-follow "Hello World" examples.
 .
 Now with extensive new sections on error messages, portability and
 floating point arithmetic!
 .
 Features a special foreword by Richard M. Stallman, principal developer
 of GCC and founder of the GNU Project.
 .
 The content of this Debian packaged version has some minor adjustments to
 match learning experiences under the Debian environment.
 .
 Please note the Debian package version tracks on the upstream tarball
 version.  When upstream releases a new version as a patch file, the Debian
 package version stays with the upstream tarball version.
 .
 The actual current upstream version is 1.1.

 This algorithm is based on integer operations which that there is no round
 errors (given accurate coefficients) the accuracy of this algorithm is based
 on 3 constants (p, q and a) where p/q is the full months percentage [ gcd(p,q)
 must be 1 ] currently it is set to 191/360 which mean that there is 191 months
 having 30 days in a span of 360 years, other months are 29 days, and a is just
 a shift.

Description: ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software
 Color management allows controlled conversion between color representation of
 input and output devices and color spaces. ICC profiles are an important part
 of color management. They are data files that represent mappings between the
 input or output color space of a particular device and the device-agnostic
 profile connection space (PCS) in accordance with the standards set by the
 International Color Consortium (ICC). This package contains a number of high
 quality ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software such as
 Scribus, Gimp, CinePaint, Krita, or Digikam. In general this package is
 useful if the software using it was built against a color management support
 library such as liblcms1 or liblcms2-2. In some software such as Scribus you
 have to explicitly enable color managemenent in the preferences to be able to
 use these profiles.

Description: Integrative Genomics Viewer
 The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that
 efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a
 smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution.
 A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of
 genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation
 sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data.
 Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources,
 its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and
 explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV
 supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is
 optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration
 on standard desktop systems.

Description: testing suite for uniform random number generators -- headers
 TestU01 is a software library, implemented in the ANSI C language, and
 offering a collection of utilities for the empirical statistical testing
 of uniform random number generators.
 .
 TestU01 implements several types of random number generators in generic
 form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or
 found in widely-used software. It provides general implementations of the
 classical statistical tests for random number generators, as well as several
 others proposed in the literature, and some original ones. These tests can
 be applied to the generators predefined in the library and to user-defined
 generators. Specific tests suites for either sequences of uniform random
 numbers in [0,1] or bit sequences are also provided, as well as basic tools
 for plotting vectors of points produced by generators and more advanced
 tools for more involved tests and usage.
 .
 This package contains the header files that developers using the TestU01
 libraries will need.

Description: German male voice for Mbrola
 This package contains a German diphone database provided in the context
 of the MBROLA project see: http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/
 .
 DE6 is a male German diphone voice created in the context of the EU project
 NECA (IST-2000-28580), with the aim of being particularly suitable for the
 flexible synthesis of expressive speech.
 .
 The main feature of DE6 is therefore that it contains a complete diphone
 set for three different voice qualities defined by their vocal effort, low
 effort ("soft voice"), medium effort ("normal or modal voice"), and high
 effort ("loud voice").
 .
 This diphone database was recorded jointly by the Institute of Phonetics at
 Saarland University and by the Language Technology Department at DFKI,
 Saarbrücken.

Description: Computer Aided Drug Discovery (CADD) Pipeline
 This package is part of the mgltools set of Python libraries which
 provide an infrastructure for the analysis of protein structures and
 their docking of chemical compounds.
 .
 The Computer Aided Drug Discovery (CADD) Pipeline is a workflow
 environment designed to support molecular dyanmics simulations
 and virtual screening experiments for in silico drug discovery,
 with a special focus on supporting the use of the Relaxed
 Complex Scheme. It includes web based access to applications
 such as NAMD, AutoDock, PDB2PQR, APBS, MGLToos and couples them
 in a flexible and scalable fashion through cloud computing.
 It is developed as a standalone application, using Vision
 (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=MGLTools#Vision) as
 the backend engine for visual programming and workflow execution.
 The scientific applications are made accessible through CADD using
 Opal Web services (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=Opal)
 for scalable and distributed computation.
 .
 The workflow components of the CADD pipeline are currently released
 as Vision networks packaged for specific processes in a modular
 fashion. These modules may be coupled at ease for more complex
 processes. In the future, they may also be accessible from workflow
 repositories such as MyExperiment.org, and from AutoDockTools.  The Opal
 services used in the CADD workflow may be accessed using programmatic
 access, the Opal Server Dashboard or other workflow clients such as
 Kepler, VisTrails or Taverna through Opal plugins available at Opal
 Sourceforge website (http://opal.nbcr.net).
 .
 Features
 .
  * Automatic launching of NAMD simulation on TeraGrid and NBCR resources,
    including experimental support for migration of simulation between
    resources.
  * Selection of representative snapshots/conformations from MD simulations
    using clustering tools such as QR factorization from VMD and Ptraj from
    Amber.
  * Support of Virtual Screening using AutoDock, AutoDock Vina
  * Support of Relaxed Complex Scheme based Virtual Screening and Rescoring
  * Visualization and analysis of Virtual Screening hits

 by default.  Each tile has a set of tabs for the windows within it.
 It also allows windows to be made 'floating' and placed freely.  Notion
 can be controlled through the keyboard alone or together with a mouse.
 .
 This package contains the files necessary for building extension
 modules to the Notion window manager

Description: keep notes, maintain ToDo lists, and do project planning in emacs
 Org-mode is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, and
 doing project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.
 .
 Org-mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
 information about projects as plain text. Org-mode is implemented on
 top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
 large files well structured. Visibility cycling and structure editing
 help to work with the tree. Tables are easily created with a built-in
 table editor. Org-mode supports ToDo items, deadlines, time stamps,
 and scheduling. It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda. Plain
 text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages,
 BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects. For printing and
 sharing of notes, an Org-mode file can be exported as a structured
 ASCII file, HTML, and LaTeX.
 .

Description: analyze and visualize phylogeographic reconstructions
 SPREAD is a user-friendly application to analyze and visualize
 phylogeographic reconstructions resulting from Bayesian inference of
 spatio-temporal diffusion.
 .
 There is a tutorial for SPREAD online at
 http://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/tutorial/spread_tutorial.html
 .
 Originally this program is named "spread".  However, there is just such a
 package inside Debian and thus a 'phy' for phylogeny was prepended.

Description: RDNAP grid correction files for PROJ
 Kadaster and Rijkswaterstaat CIV, working together under the name RDNAP,
 developed RDNAPTRANS™2008, the precise and official transformation
 between ETRS89 and the dutch national horizontal and vertical coordinate
 reference systems the Stelsel van de Rijksdriehoeksmeting (RD) and the
 Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). A ‘simplified’ procedure has been
 developed which uses a NTv2-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and RD as well as a VDatum-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and NAP. This ‘simplified’ procedure has the following limitations:
 .
  1) The rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid can only give identical results to
     RDNAPTRANS™2008 within 1 millimeter at ground level onshore and at
     mean sea level offshore. The horizontal deviation is approximately
     1 millimeter per 50 meter height difference from ground level or mean
     sea level.
  2) An exception to 1) is the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid. Transformation results within cells of the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
     that are intersected by the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid can result in deviations of up to 20 centimeter.
  3) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid cannot be used to determine deflections
     of the vertical. For this the NLGEO2004 geoid model has to be used.
  4) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid is referenced to the Bessel-1841 ellipsoid
     and cannot be used stand-alone, it has to be used in combination with
     the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid.
 .
 Taking into account the limitations listed above, the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
 and naptrans2008 VDatum-grid can be used as an alternative to
 RDNAPTRANS™2008 to transform geographic ETRS89-coordinates to
 projected RD-coordinates with grid correction applied and NAP-heights.
 .
 Note that, although the resulting RD/NAP and ETRS89 coordinates from the
 transformation will be correct, geographic Bessel-1841 coordinates will
 differ in both procedures and should only be considered as an intermediate
 result.

 Hijri Islamic Calendar converting functions, based on an enhanced algorithm
 designed by Muayyad Saleh Alsadi.
 It can be used to implement applications, gdesklets or karamba ..etc
 .
 This algorithm is based on integer operations which that there is no round
 errors (given accurate coefficients) the accuracy of this algorithm is based
 on 3 constants (p, q and a) where p/q is the full months percentage [ gcd(p,q)
 must be 1 ] currently it is set to 191/360 which mean that there is 191 months
 having 30 days in a span of 360 years, other months are 29 days, and a is just
 a shift.

  * "Free As In Freedom", on RMS by Sam Williams, is available as a markup
 sample within the package sisu
 .
 SiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document
 structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.
 .
 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is
 particularly suitable for "published" works (finalized texts as opposed to
 works that are frequently changed or updated) for which it provides a fixed
 means of reference of content. Document outputs also share semantic meta-data
 provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.
 .
 Dependencies for additional features are taken care of in sisu related
 packages.
 .
 The dummy package sisu-complete together with sisu-markup-samples installs
 the whole of SiSU.

 TestU01 implements several types of random number generators in generic
 form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or
 found in widely-used software. It provides general implementations of the
 classical statistical tests for random number generators, as well as several
 others proposed in the literature, and some original ones. These tests can
 be applied to the generators predefined in the library and to user-defined
 generators. Specific tests suites for either sequences of uniform random
 numbers in [0,1] or bit sequences are also provided, as well as basic tools
 for plotting vectors of points produced by generators and more advanced
 tools for more involved tests and usage.
 .
 This package provides the essential TestU01 architecture independent
 material, namely shared data.

Description: detection of transfer RNA genes in genomic sequence (common files)
 tRNAscan-SE identifies 99-100% of transfer RNA genes in DNA sequence while
 giving less than one false positive per 15 gigabases. Two previously described
 tRNA detection programs are used as fast, first-pass prefilters to identify
 candidate tRNAs, which are then analyzed by a highly selective tRNA covariance
 model. This work represents a practical application of RNA covariance models,
 which are general, probabilistic secondary structure profiles based on
 stochastic context-free grammars. tRNAscan-SE searches at ~ 30 000 bp/s.
 Additional extensions to tRNAscan-SE detect unusual tRNA homologues such as
 selenocysteine tRNAs, tRNA-derived repetitive elements and tRNA pseudogenes.
 .
 This package contains the architecture-independent common files.

Description: Source only package for building ucspi-tcp binary package
 Written by Dan J. Bernstein, tcpclient and tcpserver are
 powerful easy-to-use command-line tools for building TCP
 client-server applications. tcpserver provides TCP access control
 features, similar to tcp-wrappers/tcpd's hosts.allow but much
 faster; it can run high-availability services much better than
 inetd.
 .
 Real-time Blocking List support is also included in tcpserver, so
 you can run qmail-smtpd with it and avoid a lot of SPAM.
 .
 tcpclient and tcpserver conform to UCSPI, the UNIX Client-Server
 Program Interface, using the TCP protocol.
 .
 Dan Bernstein (ucspi-tcp's author) only gives permission for his code
 to be distributed in source form, or binary by approval.  This package
 has been put together to allow people to easily build a binary
 package for themselves, from source.
 .
 If there is a package called ucspi-tcp available, then Dan has approved the
 binary version of the package for distribution, so you might as well install
 that and save yourself some effort.
